## About Me

I am a passionate software developer with experience in building scalable and efficient applications. I enjoy solving complex problems and continuously learning new technologies to enhance my expertise.

## Projects

Here are some of the projects I have worked on:

1. **Ecommerce Website**: Django React Store – A full-stack e-commerce web app built with Django and React featuring JWT authentication, Razorpay payment integration, and a responsive UI. Includes admin dashboard, shopping cart, and order management with RESTful APIs. The project is designed to simulate the core functionalities of an online shopping platform, enabling both end-users and administrators to interact with the system through user-friendly interfaces and backend logic. It demonstrates the implementation of real-world e-commerce features while showcasing Java-based web development skills.
   - Python, Django, ReactJS, SQLite.

2. **N-Queens**: The N-Queens project typically involves solving the N-Queens problem, which is a classic computer science problem. The problem is to place N chess queens on an N×N chessboard so that no two queens threaten each other. This means no two queens can share the same row, column, or diagonal.
   - Java
